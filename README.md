## Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:

- **Analyzing Popularity Trends**: Investigating when and where powerlifting has gained popularity, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.
- **Equipment Impact Analysis**: Examining how different equipment affects athletes' total weight lifted, shown in Figures 3 and 4.
- **Gender Performance Comparison**: Comparing male and female athletes in terms of absolute and relative strength to highlight gender differences in performance and promote inclusivity.
- **Strength Measurement Evaluation**: Identifying the best metrics for assessing strength in powerlifting, providing a nuanced understanding of effective strength assessment.

In summary, this project aims to showcase powerlifting as a sport and increase its visibility.

## Novelty
This project introduces several original contributions to data visualization:

- **Stacked Histogram**: A unique stacked histogram was employed to analyze absolute strength differences between male and female powerlifters. This technique effectively visualizes strength distribution across genders, revealing both differences and overlaps (Figure 5).
- **Systematic Classification**: The dataset was classified according to weight and age categories following the standards set by the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF), ensuring accurate analysis.

## Technical Challenges and Innovations
The following tools and techniques were utilized in this project:

- **Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were used for initial data exploration and visualization, enabling the identification of key trends.
- **Video Editing**: Canva was utilized for video editing, enhancing the aesthetic quality of visualizations and ensuring clear communication of information.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Animated visualizations were created to aid viewer comprehension, although challenges arose due to Canva's limitations regarding interactivity.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Null Values**: The dataset contained numerous null values due to varying record-keeping standards across different powerlifting federations. Addressing data consistency was crucial for accurate analysis.
- **Dynamic Visual Limitations**: Achieving desired interactivity levels in certain graphs proved challenging within Canva.

## Conclusion
This Powerlifting Data Analysis/Visualization project not only provides insights into the sport but also emphasizes the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding athletic performance. The innovative visual techniques employed serve to enhance engagement and understanding among viewers.
